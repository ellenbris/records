# Personal Health Record App
People with Chronic Diseases often need to keep record of any healthcare documents or data theyâ€™ve received, along with the time of that interaction. Being able to pull this up for review when they see a new specialist doctor can help ensure they receive the best care (since records may not otherwise be shared).
Features: 
- Show patient a list of their medical records, sorted by descending date
- Add a new record
